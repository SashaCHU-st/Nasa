# Write steps

This is mine project that I was pratcicing to make fullstack application.
There is still some bugs, i know, and time to time little by little I am trying to fix them;

The code is contain a lot lof comments because by doing this project, it was new for me,
I was making notes for myself in order to learn and remember what does what. 

The project feels never ready, because always find some small issuies, and it is cool to learn how to fix them
also add some more features

I am not good at design, so design looks as simple as possible
