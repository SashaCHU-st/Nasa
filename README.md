# Write steps

This is a project I worked on to practice building a full stack application.

There are still some bugs, which I am aware of, and from time to time, I try to fix them little by little.

The code contains a lot of comments because, as this was a new experience for me, I made notes to help myself learn and remember what each part does.

The project feels like itâ€™s never truly finished because I keep discovering small issues. However, I enjoy learning how to fix them and adding new features along the way.
